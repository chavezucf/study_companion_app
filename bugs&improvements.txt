BUGS
=========================

1️⃣ I need to click the answer twice to show the "Next Question" button
- Behavior: On first answer click, feedback shows correctly, but Next button does not appear until second click or rerun.
- Hypothesis: Possible Streamlit rerun ordering issue or missing immediate UI update after st.session_state.tf_last_answer_submitted = True

---

2️⃣ "Start New Session" works, but the "Progress to next level" bar does not show updated XP immediately.
- Behavior: XP is correctly added in profile_manager, but progress bar appears hidden or stale on first rerender after new session.
- Hypothesis: Possible due to rerun flow — st.rerun() resets the page, but XP bar state may need explicit refresh at top of page.

IMPROVEMENTS
=========================

1️⃣ Hide the navbar
- Desired: Completely hide the "Deploy" and "⋮" navbar in top right of Streamlit app (not just sidebar)
- Unknown how to do this in Streamlit CSS — research required

---

2️⃣ Add Subject Filter / Home Page for True/False
- Desired flow:
    - When starting True/False module:
        - First page lets user select one or more Subjects to study
        - Then only questions from selected Subjects are used in session
    - Purpose: More targeted study mode, more replayable
- Needs:
    - Refactor of session state init
    - Subject filter in st.multiselect
    - Filtered shuffle of questions.json


=========================

=========================

Features:

✅ Full command with code editor
✅ Fill in the blank (multiple text fields)
✅ MCQ
✅ Mixed subjects (Azure CLI + Bicep CLI)
✅ Consistent with True/False page

---

IMPROVEMENTS (to add later):

- Add subject filter (like planned for True/False)
- Use streamlit-code-editor for real code editing UI

- Add "Practice Mode" vs "Test Mode"
